          # Elasticsearch/OpenSearch generally return `true`/`false` for Boolean fields. However, there's one exception to that[^1]:
          #
          # > Aggregations like the terms aggregation use 1 and 0 for the key, and the strings "true" and "false" for the key_as_string.
          #
          # Since we get 0/1 in _only_ this one case, we translate it back to false/true here. While a bit hacky, there isn't a widespread
          # need to handle Booleans like this in other places. It would be nice to apply this logic in the `NonCompositeGroupingAdapter`
          # (since the `composite` aggregation used by the `CompositeGroupingAdapter` does not suffer from this issue!) but we don't have
          # ready access to the field type there to know that 0/1 mean false/true.
